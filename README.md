# 🧠 AI-Based Mental Health Screening System

This is a machine learning-powered web application built with **Python, Flask, and SHAP**, designed to screen for **Depression, Anxiety, and Stress** using the standardized **DASS-42** questionnaire. It provides **explainable AI (XAI)** outputs, user history, interactive plots, and bilingual (English/Sinhala) support.

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts **Depression, Anxiety, and Stress** severity levels (Normal / Moderate / Severe).
- Built with **Logistic Regression** and SHAP for transparent predictions.
- Clean and bilingual UI with **light/dark mode** and responsive design.
- Supports **anonymous** mode or **registered accounts** with history tracking.
- Interactive **plots** for trends over time using Plotly.
- Personalized **tips & recommendations** based on results.
- Admin panel for **content management** and **system logs**.

## 🩺 Input Parameters
- DASS-42 questionnaire responses (42 questions)
- Optional: Raw answers for detailed tracking
- User account details (if registered)

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core development
- **Flask** – Web application framework
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn** – Data processing & ML model training
